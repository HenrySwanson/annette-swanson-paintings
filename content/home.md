In painting nature, I see things that are not readily noticed. Snow may seem white, but on closer look, there is the lavender or blue, gold or gray. There are so many colors and characteristics of water, trees, and sky.

I look at certain images and fall in love with the composition. I get that feeling â€“ this is going to make a good painting.

Right now, I am emerging. I studied eleven years at the Art Academy in St. Paul and have focused almost exclusively on plein air painting the past four years. I want to take a beautiful image and make it accessible to others.

This is my journey.
